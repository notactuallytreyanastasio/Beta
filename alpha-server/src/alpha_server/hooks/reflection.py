"""The `/hooks/reflection` endpoint — Stop hook, sometimes-fires reflection reminder.

Fires on turns 1, 4, 7, 10, ... — every third turn starting at 1. Turn count
is per-session, stored in Redis, with a 7-day TTL.

Stop hooks don't use additionalContext (that's a UserPromptSubmit shape). Instead
they return `decision: "block"` + `reason: <text>`, which prevents the turn from
ending and feeds `reason` to the model as the instruction to continue. So a
firing-reflection-hook *both* keeps the conversation going AND surfaces the
reminder text in-band. A non-firing turn returns nothing (the turn ends normally).

Also: `stop_hook_active` arrives `true` when Claude Code is already continuing
because of a Stop hook. We must NOT re-block in that case (Claude Code overrides
after 8 consecutive blocks, but we shouldn't lean on the safety net). Treat
`stop_hook_active=true` as "this is the continuation turn from a previous block;
let it end normally so Jeffery can speak next."
