"""Cortex MCP server — stdio mounting via `mcp`, tools registered by side effect.

The `mcp` instance lives in `server`; tool modules are imported here for
their side effects (each module's `@mcp.tool` decorator registers its tool
against the shared instance). Mounting `mcp.http_app(...)` inside the
FastAPI app picks up the full tool surface.
