"""Integration test for `store_memory` against a live dev database.

Requires Postgres reachable at the configured DATABASE_URL and the
embedding service reachable at EMBEDDING_BASE_URL. Run via `uv run pytest`.

This test WRITES one row to cortex.memories per run. The dev DB is
disposable (next `just dev-init` wipes it), and the row is marked with
a [TEST] prefix so it's identifiable in the DB.
