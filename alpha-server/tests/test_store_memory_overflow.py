"""Integration test: what happens when content exceeds the embedding context?

This test sends a known-too-large memory through store_memory and asserts that
the failure surface is "tool error returned cleanly," not "tool crashes."

Preconditions for this test to do what it says:
  - The embedding service (Bifrost → Ember + fallbacks) cannot embed the input.
  - On May 19 2026 Ember's n_ctx was 2048 and the fallback (Jeffery's MacBook
    LM Studio) was OFF, so a 2786-token input bounced off both legs and Bifrost
    returned an HTTP error. If you re-run this test in a future where Ember's
    n_ctx has been raised, the test will fail because the embedding succeeded —
    that failure is informative, not broken.

The 2786-token reference content comes from the longest memory ever stored
in cortex.memories at the time of writing (memory #16554, the April 4 2026
chronicle). Reproducing it byte-for-byte here would be wasteful; we generate
a synthetic string of the same approximate token count instead.
